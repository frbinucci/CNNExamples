To test this code you should create a directory called "dataset" inside the working directory of the project. Then you should copy the content of this dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/slothkong/10-monkey-species) inside.
Rename directories as "training" and "validation", and copy inside the dataset directory the file "monkey_labels.txt" attached to this repository.
